    "## Datetime in NumPy and pandas\n",
    "\n",
    "A preface regarding terminology in the following section: datetime refers to the specific module of that name in the Python standard library or to the specific class within that module. Datetime (or uncapitalized, datetime) refers to any date/time-related object from any library or language.  \n",
    "\n",
    "You’ve learned that the datetime [module in Python’s standard library](https://docs.python.org/3/library/datetime.html) contains a number of classes used to work with time data, including date, time, datetime, timedelta, timezone, and tzinfo. Remember, modules are similar to libraries, in that they are groups of related classes and functions, but they are generally subcomponents of libraries. Classes are  data types that bundle data and functionality together.\n",
    "\n",
    "NumPy and pandas have their own datetime classes that offer significant performance boosts when working with large datasets. Pandas datetime classes, like the rest of the pandas library, are built on NumPy. These classes have very similar (and in many cases identical) functionality to Python’s native datetime classes, but they run more efficiently due to NumPy and pandas’ vectorization capabilities. Therefore, although you _can_ use datetime data in pandas, it’s generally better to use NumPy or pandas datetime objects when working in pandas, if possible.\n",
    "\n",
    "[NumPy’s datetime classes](https://numpy.org/doc/stable/reference/arrays.datetime.html) include, most notably, datetime64 and timedelta64. Like datetime objects, datetime64 objects contain date and time information in a single data structure; and, like timedelta objects, timedelta64 objects contain information pertaining to spans of time. \n",
    "\n",
    "[Pandas’ datetime classes](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/user_guide/timeseries.html) include Timestamp, Timedelta, Period, and DateOffset.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Because these classes are efficient and dynamic in their capabilities, you often don’t need to import the datetime module when working with datetime data in pandas. Also, pandas will automatically recognize datetime-like data and convert it to the appropriate class when possible. Here’s an example:"
