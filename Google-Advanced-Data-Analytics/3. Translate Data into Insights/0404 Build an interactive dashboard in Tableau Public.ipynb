    "- The data dashboard includes two dynamic worksheets.\n",

    "- The filters on the dashboard sidebar filter the desired data.\n",
    "    \n",
    "- There are two filters shown and one legend.\n",

    "- Another filter connects to the “By Weekday” data and allows the data to filter by day of the week.\n",
