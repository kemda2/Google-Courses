    "\n",
    "In this activity, you will demonstrate your ability to organize, present, and share the stories within data. You will also update team members through an executive summary, demonstrating your ability to organize and communicate key information. \n",
    "\n",
    "For additional information on how to complete this activity, review the previous readings: [_End-of-course project introduction_](https://www.coursera.org/learn/foundations-of-data-science/supplement/9Opfe/end-of-course-portfolio-project-introduction) and [_Course 3 end-of-course portfolio project overview: Waze_](https://www.coursera.org/learn/go-beyond-the-numbers-translate-data-into-insight/supplement/pFnXC/course-3-end-of-course-portfolio-project-overview-waze).\n",

    "## Scenario\n",
    "\n",
    "Your team is making progress on their project to develop a machine learning model to predict user churn. So far, you’ve completed a project proposal and used Python to inspect and organize Waze’s user data.\n",
    "\n",
    "You check your inbox and notice a new message from Chidi Ga, your team’s Senior Data Analyst. Chidi is pleased with the work you have already completed and requests your assistance with Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and further data visualization. You also notice a follow-up email from the Director of Data Analysis, Harriet Hadzic. Harriet suggests including an executive summary of your analysis to share with teammates. \n",

    "Hi there,\n",
    "\n",
    "Thanks for the amazing work you’ve done so far. \n",
    "\n",
    "We’re ready to perform EDA on our user data. Has May told you what the leadership team expects when it comes to EDA? If not, think of it as a “show your work” kind of report. They will want to see a Python notebook showing the structuring and cleaning you did, and any data visualizations you created to better understand the data. To start, I suggest you create a box plot of the variable “drives,” and a scatter plot of the variables “drives” and “sessions.” Feel free to add any other visuals you think are useful. \n",
    "\n",
    "By the way, I cc’d our director, Harriet Hadzic, who is on the leadership team and will be reviewing our analysis. @Harriet, I want to keep you informed on our progress! \n",
