    "\n",
    "In this activity, you will demonstrate your ability to organize, present, and share data stories on Tableau Public. You will also update team members through an executive summary, demonstrating your ability to organize and communicate key information.\n",
    "\n",
    "For additional information on how to complete this activity, review the previous readings: [_End-of-course portfolio project introduction_](https://www.coursera.org/learn/foundations-of-data-science/supplement/9Opfe/end-of-course-portfolio-project-introduction)  and  [_Course 3 end-of-course portfolio project overview: Automatidata_](https://www.coursera.org/learn/go-beyond-the-numbers-translate-data-into-insight/supplement/jKAqn/course-3-end-of-course-portfolio-project-overview-automatidata).\n",

    "## Scenario\n",
    "\n",
    "Your team is still in the early stages of their project for the New York City Taxi and Limousine Commission (TLC). So far, you’ve completed a project proposal and used Python to inspect and organize the TLC dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "You check your inbox and notice a new message from Luana Rodriguez, the Senior Data Analyst at Automatidata. Luana is pleased with the work you have already completed and requests your assistance with some exploratory data analysis (EDA) and data visualization. You also notice a follow-up email from Udo Bankole, the Director of Data Analysis. Udo suggests including an executive summary of your analysis to share with teammates. \n",
    "\n",
    "_**Note:**_ _Team member names used in this workplace scenario are fictional and are not representative of the New York City TLC._\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "**Email from Luana Rodriguez, Senior Data Analyst**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Subject:** New York City TLC EDA & Vizzes\n",
    "\n",
    "**From:**  “Luana Rodriguez” Luana@automatidata\n",
    "\n",
    "**Cc:** “Deshawn Washington,” Deshawn@automatidata; “Udo Bankole,” Udo@automatidata\n",
    "\n",
    "Hi there,\n",
    "\n",
    "Thanks for the amazing work you’ve done so far. \n",
    "\n",
    "We’re ready to perform EDA on the taxi data from the New York City TLC to get a general understanding of what taxi ridership looks like. Has Deshawn told you what the management team expects when it comes to EDA? If not, think of it as a “show your work” kind of report. They will want to see a Python notebook showing the structuring and cleaning you did, as well as any matplotlib/seaborn visualizations you plotted to help us understand the data. I would suggest at the very least a box plot of the ride durations and some time series plots, like a breakdown by quarter or month? Whatever you think makes most sense. \n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, the management team has recently asked all EDA to include Tableau visualizations. We’ve found these to be particularly helpful in status reports to the client and board members. Make sure it is easy to understand to someone who isn’t data savvy, and remember that the assistant director at the New York City TLC is a person with visual impairments. I understand you have some Tableau experience? Let me know if you need help with this. \n",
    "\n",
    "By the way, I Cc’d our director, Udo, who is on the management team and will be reviewing/approving our analysis before the project manager reports it back to the client. @Udo, I just want to keep you informed on the progress! \n",
