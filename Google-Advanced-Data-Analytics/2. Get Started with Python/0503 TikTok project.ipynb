    "## Activity Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "In this activity, you will complete a project that showcases your ability to use Python to import, inspect, and organize data. You will also update team members through an executive summary, demonstrating your ability to organize and communicate key information. \n",
    "\n",
    "For additional information on how to complete this activity, review the previous readings: [_End-of-course project introduction_](https://www.coursera.org/learn/foundations-of-data-science/supplement/9Opfe/end-of-course-portfolio-project-introduction) and [_Course 2 end-of-course portfolio project overview: TikTok_](https://www.coursera.org/learn/get-started-with-python/supplement/50gsf/course-2-end-of-course-portfolio-project-overview-tiktok).\n",
    "\n",
    "Be sure to complete this activity before moving on. The next course item will provide you with completed exemplars to compare to your own work. You will not be able to access the exemplars until you have completed this activity. \n",

    "## Scenario\n",
    "\n",
    "The team’s latest project is in its early stages of developing a machine learning model to classify claims in videos.\n",
    "\n",
    "Previously, you were asked to complete a project proposal by your supervisor, Rosie Mae Bradshaw. You have received notice that the project proposal submitted by the team has been approved and your team has been given access to TikTok’s user data. To get clear insights, the data must be inspected, organized, and prepared for analysis. \n",
    "\n",
    "You discover two new emails in your inbox: one from your supervisor, Rosie Mae Bradshaw, and one from Willow Jaffey, the data team’s Data Science Lead. Review the emails, then follow the provided instructions to complete the PACE strategy document, the code notebook, and the executive summary. \n",

    "Good morning,\n",
    "\n",
    "I have a couple of updates on our latest project. The leadership team has approved the project proposal that we completed previously. Thanks for all of your great work so far. Additionally, I just received an email from our Project Management Officer, Mary Joanna Rodgers that the data team is clear to proceed.\n",
    "\n",
    "Before we begin the process of Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), we could really use your help with coding and prepping the data. During your interview you mentioned that you worked with Python specifically in the Google certificate program you completed. That experience sounds applicable here. \n",
    "\n",
    "Orion Rainier (Cc’d above) started a Jupyter notebook with the relevant dataset (attached). Orion is very involved in the final stages of another project. I’m sure your assistance in completing the coding and setting up the notebook for the project would be greatly appreciated. \n",
    "\n",
    "Orion, do you mind sharing the details? \n",

    "\n",
    "With the project proposal approved, we are ready to begin the process of preparing the claim classification data. The goal of this project is to ultimately build a machine learning model that can streamline the claims process by identifying whether statements made in videos are claims or opinions. \n",
    "\n",
    "A claim refers to information that is either unsourced or from an unverified source. For example, “The news reported that someone revealed that around 50% of the mined gold on Earth comes from one source.”\n",
    "\n",
    "Opinions refer to the personal beliefs or thoughts of a group or an individual. Here’s an example, “In my opinion the most productive work day of the week is Tuesday.”\n",
    "\n",
    "There are a number of data team members committed to adjusting the machine learning developed for the last project, so your help is greatly appreciated!\n",
    "\n",
    "Until we finish the prior project, there is no need to do a full EDA on this data. We will get to that soon. Do you mind importing the data (attached) and reviewing it for the team? It would be fantastic if you could include a summary of the column Data types, data value nonnull counts, relevant and irrelevant columns, along with anything else code related you think is worth sharing/showing in the notebook? You’ll need to select a couple of variables to focus on. Include their minimum and maximum values. I haven’t looked closely at the data yet, but it would be really helpful if you can create meaningful variables by combining or modifying the structures given.\n",
