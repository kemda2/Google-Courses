    "## Activity Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "In this activity, you will demonstrate your understanding of an effective data science workflow by completing a project proposal, intended to communicate information about project tasks and milestones with your team. You have previously learned about a tool that can help you complete project planning and development—the PACE strategy document. You will use the PACE strategy document to guide you through the process of creating a project proposal. \n",
    "\n",
    "For additional information on how to complete this activity, review the previous readings: [_End-of-course project introduction_](https://www.coursera.org/learn/foundations-of-data-science/supplement/9Opfe/end-of-course-portfolio-project-introduction) and [_Course 1 end-of-course portfolio project overview: Waze_](https://www.coursera.org/learn/foundations-of-data-science/supplement/vsuvL/course-1-end-of-course-portfolio-project-overview-waze).\n",

    "## Scenario\n",
    "\n",
    "You are the newest member of the Waze data analytics team. Your supervisor, May Santner, has sent you the following email asking you to complete a project proposal for the team’s churn project. Review the email, then follow the provided instructions to complete the PACE strategy document and the project proposal.\n",

    "**Subject:** Welcome to Waze!\n",
    "\n",
    "**From:** “May Santner,” May@waze\n",
    "\n",
    "Hello, and welcome to the team! \n",
    "\n",
    "We are so happy to have you. We have been growing quickly and we can really use your expertise. \n",
    "\n",
    "Leadership has asked our team to build a machine learning model that predicts user churn. The model will be based on a sample of Waze user data. An accurate model will help our company prevent user churn, improve user retention, and increase growth. \n",
    "\n",
    "For your first task, please draft a plan of action for the team. Include questions we need to answer before we get started on the project, important details to consider at the beginning of the project, and action items for different stages of the project. \n",
    "\n",
    "I understand you’ve completed a Google Careers Certificate on Advanced Data Analytics and learned the skills for planning, analyzing, constructing, and executing strategies for data science. Sylvester did one of the Google certificates and really loved it. They learned some incredible skills. Maybe you can use the skills you learned in that program to get started? \n",

    "### Step 2: Review the first page of the PACE strategy document\n",
    "\n",
    "The **Course 1 PACE strategy document** will guide you in determining the tasks necessary to complete the project proposal. As you approach each section, keep the PACE framework in mind. Consider how and when a data professional would plan, analyze, construct, and execute each task. Begin by reading through the instructions and information on page 1 of the PACE strategy document.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 3: Complete the Data Project Questions & Considerations\n",
    "\n",
    "In the **Data Project Questions & Considerations** section of the PACE strategy document, you are presented with questions designed to help you unlock a deeper understanding of data analytics. Complete the questions in this section.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 4: Complete the PACE workflow\n",
    "\n",
    "In the **PACE workflow** section of the PACE strategy document, you are presented with a list of tasks identified as necessary for the Waze project. Classify these tasks into the appropriate PACE stages and explain each classification.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 5: Complete the project proposal\n",
    "\n",
    "As part of your work on the PACE strategy document, you identified PACE stages for tasks that need to be completed in the Waze project. This information will help you assign tasks to milestones in the **Waze project proposal.** Complete the project proposal by:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Entering a project title\n",
    "    \n",
    "- Adding an overview of the project\n",
    "    \n",
    "- Identifying the order of tasks \n",
    "    \n",
    "- Associating each task with the relevant milestone \n",
