    "## Activity Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "In this activity, you will showcase your ability to use statistical methods to analyze and interpret data. In particular, you will use descriptive statistics and hypothesis testing. You will also update team members through an executive summary, demonstrating your ability to organize and communicate key information. \n",
    "\n",
    "For additional information on how to complete this activity, review the previous readings: [_End-of-course project introduction_](https://www.coursera.org/learn/foundations-of-data-science/supplement/9Opfe/end-of-course-portfolio-project-introduction) and [_Course 4 end-of-course portfolio project overview: TikTok_](https://www.coursera.org/learn/the-power-of-statistics/supplement/SLD98/course-4-end-of-course-portfolio-project-overview-tiktok).\n",

    "## Scenario\n",
    "\n",
    "The TikTok data analytics team has completed the first three milestones of the claims classification project and is nearing the halfway point. So far, the team has completed a project proposal, and used Python to perform exploratory data analysis on the dataset for the claims classification project. The team also produced data visualizations in both Python and Tableau to share with stakeholders. The next step is to use statistical methods to analyze and interpret the claims classification data. \n",
    "\n",
    "You receive a new email from Mary Joanna Rodgers, one of TikTok’s project management officers. Mary Joanna informs the data team about a new request: to determine whether there is a statistically significant difference in the number of views for TikTok videos posted by verified accounts versus unverified accounts. You also receive follow-up emails from Data Science Manager, Rosie Mae Bradshaw and Data Science Lead, Willow Jaffey. These emails share the details of the analysis. A final email from Data Scientist, Orion Rainier, details your next assignment: to conduct a hypothesis test on verified versus unverified accounts in terms of video view count. \n",

    "\n",
    "On that note, they have requested an additional item to be added to the initial project scope. We are interested in whether there is a statistical difference in the data between verified and unverified accounts. Do you have any indication which variable would be most insightful to test in terms of verified and unverified accounts? \n",
