    "## Activity Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "In this activity, you will showcase your ability to use statistical methods to analyze and interpret data. In particular, you will compute descriptive statistics and conduct a hypothesis test. You will also update team members and stakeholders through an executive summary, demonstrating your ability to organize and communicate key information. \n",
    "\n",
    "For additional information on how to complete this activity, review the previous readings: [_End-of-course project introduction_](https://www.coursera.org/learn/foundations-of-data-science/supplement/9Opfe/end-of-course-portfolio-project-introduction) and [_Course 4 end-of-course portfolio project overview: Waze_](https://www.coursera.org/learn/the-power-of-statistics/supplement/oPhxt/course-4-end-of-course-portfolio-project-overview-waze).\n",

    "## Scenario\n",
    "\n",
    "Your Waze team is nearing the midpoint of their project to develop a machine learning model to predict user churn. So far, you’ve completed a project proposal, and used Python to explore and analyze Waze’s user data. You’ve also used Python to create data visualizations. The next step is to use statistical methods to analyze and interpret your data. \n",
    "\n",
    "You receive a new email from Sylvester Esperanza, your project manager. Sylvester tells your team about a new request from leadership: to analyze the relationship between mean amount of rides and device type. You also discover follow-up emails from three other team members: May Santner, Chidi Ga, and Harriet Hadzic. These emails discuss the details of the analysis. A final email from Chidi includes your specific assignment: to conduct a two-sample hypothesis test. \n",

    "On that note, they have requested a new deliverable be added to the initial project scope. They would like a statistical analysis of ride data based on device type. In particular, leadership wants to know if there is a statistically significant difference in mean amount of rides between iPhone® users and Android™ users. \n",
    "\n",
    "Should you conclude that the difference in mean amount of rides between iPhone users and Android users is statistically significant, please discuss next steps: what are your thoughts on strategies our team could implement to address these differences, such as improving user experience on a specific device? \n",
