    "\n",
    "In this activity, you will showcase your ability to use statistical methods to analyze and interpret data. In particular, you will use descriptive statistics and hypothesis testing to conduct an A/B test. You will also update team members through an executive summary, demonstrating your ability to organize and communicate key information. \n",
    "\n",
    "For additional information on how to complete this activity, review the previous readings: [_End-of-course portfolio project introduction_](https://www.coursera.org/learn/foundations-of-data-science/supplement/9Opfe/end-of-course-portfolio-project-introduction) and [_Course 4 end-of-course portfolio project overview: Automatidata_](https://www.coursera.org/learn/the-power-of-statistics/supplement/W9Wjf/course-4-end-of-course-portfolio-project-overview-automatidata).\n",

    "## Scenario\n",
    "\n",
    "Your team at Automatidata is nearing the midpoint of their project for the New York City Taxi & Limousine Commission (TLC). So far, you’ve completed a project proposal and used Python to explore and analyze the TLC dataset. You’ve also used both Python and Tableau to create data visualizations. The next step is to use statistical methods to analyze and interpret your data. \n",
    "\n",
    "You receive a new email from Uli King, Automatidata’s project manager. Uli tells your team about a new request from the New York City TLC: to analyze the relationship between fare amount and payment type. You also discover follow-up emails from three other team members: Deshawn Washington, Luana Rodriguez, and Udo Bankole. These emails discuss the details of the analysis. A final email from Luana includes your specific assignment: to conduct an A/B test. \n",
    "\n",
    "_**Notes on the fictional nature of this project and data assumptions:**_ \n",
    "\n",
    "_Please note the following considerations when preparing your project. When making data-driven inferences in your professional lives, you will need to perform comprehensive Exploratory Data Analysis and cross-check your own data sources and self-made assumptions. As outlined in the following notes, there is often a gap between theory and practice._\n",
    "\n",
    "- The team member names used in this workplace scenario are fictional and are not representative of the New York City TLC.\n",
    "    \n",
    "- The following scenario asks you to conduct an A/B test. An A/B test can only be performed in an experiment with randomly selected groups. In this scenario, this project makes the claim that (fictitiously) randomly grouped riders were asked to pay with a certain payment type in order to make data-driven inferences.\n",
    "    \n",
    "- All riders are assumed to be able to pay with cash or card (in practice, riders might not carry cash and have to pay with card, or vice versa).\n",

    "\n",
    "Really excellent work so far. Everyone over at New York City TLC is impressed with the results–especially the analysis on the last report! Thanks so much for the hard work. \n",
    "\n",
    "On that note, they have requested an additional item to be added to the initial project scope. They would like a detailed statistical analysis of payment type. That is, do the customers who use a credit card pay higher fare amounts than those who use cash? \n",
    "\n",
    "That said, the New York City TLC team is asking us to consider the following: \n",
    "\n",
    "- The relationship between fare amount and payment type. \n",
    "    \n",
    "- Test the hypothesis that customers who use a credit card pay higher fare amounts.\n",
    "    \n",
    "- Should you conclude that there is a statistically significant relationship between credit card payment and fare amount, discuss what the next steps should be: what are your thoughts on strategies our team could implement to encourage customers to pay with credit card?\n",
